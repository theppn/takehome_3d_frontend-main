# React Takehome Project

This project is a simplified 3D modeling application. It demonstrates various UI and state management concepts, as well as intentional design flaws. The purpose of the exercise is to <ins>complete the shape list component on the right panel</ins> as well as <ins>improve the overall quality of the whole project</ins>. You are free to determine what to improve, as long as the following features remain functional.

The takehome will be evaluated on the code quality, design and architecture choices taken and overall rendering performance. In that spirit, we request that a render counter be implemented for each React component.

## Features

- **Toolbar**:
  - Change the project name.
  - Undo/redo shape actions.
  - Clear all shapes.
  - Displays the total number of shapes in the scene.

- **Left Panel**:
  - Add shapes (sphere, cube, cylinder) to the 3D scene at random positions and with random colors.

- **Main View**:
  - Displays 3D shapes using Three.js.
  - Supports camera controls.

- **Right Panel**:
  - Displays the project name and a list of shapes in the scene. This feature needs to be implemented as part of this exercise.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run build
